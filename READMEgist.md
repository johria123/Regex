## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors in regular expressions are used to specify the position of a match within a string. They do not match characters themselves but rather positions within the text.
### Quantifiers
Quantifiers modify the number of occurrences of the preceding element.
### Grouping Constructs
Grouping and capturing are essential concepts in regular expressions that allow you to define and extract
portions of a matched pattern. By using parentheses (), you can create groups within your regex pattern.
### Bracket Expressions
A bracket expression, also known as a character class, is a way to specify a set of characters within
square brackets [] in a regular expression. It defines a group of characters, and the regular
expression engine matches any single character from that defined set.
### Character Classes
Character classes allow you to match any one of a set of characters.
Common Character Classes:
[abc]: Matches 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
[0-9]: Matches any digit from 0 to 9.
[^A-Za-z]: Matches any character that is not an uppercase or lowercase letter.</p>
### The OR Operator
In regular expressions, the "or" operator is represented by the pipe symbol (|). It functions as a
logical OR, allowing you to specify alternative patterns. The regular expression will match if any
of the alternatives match. Here's how you can use the "or" operator:</p>
### Flags
Flags in regualar expression are modifiers that alter the behavior of the pattern matching. Flags
are added to the end of a regular expression and are usually denoted by letters. Different
programming languages and regex libraries may use different flag syntax, but some common ones

### Character Escapes
In regular expressions character escapes are special sequences of characters that have a specific meaning and are used to represent characters that may have special significance or be challenging to represent directly. In regular expressions, a backslash () is used as an escape character to indicate that the following character should be treated as a literal character, not as part of the regular expression syntax. Here are some common character escapes:
