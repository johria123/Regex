            <li>Introduction to Regular Expressions</li>
            <p>Literals:
                Literals are characters that match themselves. In a regex, any alphanumeric character, such
                as letters or numbers, is treated as a literal.
                Example: The regex a will match the character 'a' in a string.
                Metacharacters:

                Metacharacters are special characters in a regex that have a reserved meaning and are used
                to define the structure of a pattern.
                Common Metacharacters:
                . (Dot): Matches any character except a newline.
                ^ (Caret): Anchors the regex at the beginning of a line.
                $ (Dollar): Anchors the regex at the end of a line.
                * (Asterisk): Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.
                + (Plus): Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element.
                ? (Question Mark): Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding element.
                | (Pipe): Acts as an OR operator, allowing for alternatives.</p>

            <li>Anchors</li>

            <p>Anchors in regular expressions are used to specify the position of a match within a string. They do not
                match characters themselves but rather positions within the text. Here are the commonly used anchors:

                ^ (Caret) - Start of Line Anchor:

                This anchor asserts that the following regex pattern must appear at the beginning of a line.
                Example: ^Hello will match any string that starts with "Hello."
                $ (Dollar) - End of Line Anchor:

                This anchor asserts that the preceding regex pattern must appear at the end of a line.
                Example: World$ will match any string that ends with "World."
                \b - Word Boundary Anchor:

                The word boundary anchor matches a position where a word starts or ends. It does not consume
                any characters.
                Example: \bword\b will match the word "word" but not "password" or "words."
           </p>
           
            <li>Quantifiers</li>

            <p>Quantifiers modify the number of occurrences of the preceding element.
                Common Quantifiers:
                *: Matches zero or more occurrences.
                +: Matches one or more occurrences.
                ?: Matches zero or one occurrence.
                {n}: Matches exactly n occurrences.
                {n,}: Matches n or more occurrences.
                {n,m}: Matches between n and m occurrences.</p>
            <li>Character Classes</li>

            <p>Definition: Character classes allow you to match any one of a set of characters.
                Common Character Classes:
                [abc]: Matches 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
                [0-9]: Matches any digit from 0 to 9.
                [^A-Za-z]: Matches any character that is not an uppercase or lowercase letter.</p>
            <li>Grouping and Capturing</li>

            <p>Grouping and capturing are essential concepts in regular expressions that allow you to define and extract
                portions of a matched pattern. By using parentheses (), you can create groups within your regex pattern.
                Here's an explanation of grouping and capturing:

                Grouping (()):

                Parentheses are used to create groups within a regex pattern. A group can contain one or
                more characters or sub-patterns.
                Example:
                (ab)+ matches one or more occurrences of the sequence "ab."
                (red|blue) matches either "red" or "blue."
                Capturing Groups (( and )):

            </p>

            <li>Assertions</li>
            Assertions in regular expressions are used to specify conditions that must be met for a match to occur. They
            do not consume characters in the string but rather assert whether a certain condition is true at a
            particular position. There are both positive and negative assertions. Here are some common assertions:

            ^ (Caret) - Start of Line Assertion:

            Definition:

            Asserts that the following pattern must occur at the beginning of a line.
            Example: ^Start matches "Start" only if it appears at the beginning of a line.
            $ (Dollar) - End of Line Assertion:

            <li>Character Escapes</li>

            <p>Character escapes in regular expressions are used to represent characters that have special meaning
            or are difficult to represent directly. By using a backslash \ followed by a specific character, you
            can create an escape sequence. Here are some common character escapes:

                    usuage:

                    Represents a newline character.
                    Represents a tab character.
                    Represents a carriage return character.
                    Represents any digit (0-9).
                    Represents any non-digit character.
                    Represents any word character (alphanumeric + underscore).
                    Represents any non-word character.
                    Represents any whitespace character (space, tab, newline).
                    Represents any non-whitespace character.
                    Represents a literal dot character.
                    Represents a literal backslash character.
                    </p>

                <li>flags</li>
               
                <p> In regular expressions, flags are modifiers that alter the behavior of the pattern matching. Flags
                    are added to the end of a regular expression and are usually denoted by letters. Different
                    programming languages and regex libraries may use different flag syntax, but some common ones
                    include:

                    i - Case Insensitive:

                    usuage:

                    Ignores the case of the characters while matching.
                    Example: /pattern/i matches "Pattern," "pattern," or "PATTERN."
                   

                    Searches for all occurrences of the pattern in the entire string, not just the first one.
                    Example: /pattern/g matches all occurrences of "pattern" in a string.
                    

                    Changes the behavior of ^ and $ anchors to match the start and end of each line within a
                    multiline string.
                    Example: /pattern/m matches "pattern" at the start of any line in a multiline string.
                 

                    Changes the behavior of the dot (.) to match any character, including newline characters.
                    Example: /pattern/s matches "pattern" even if it spans multiple lines.
                   
                </p>

                <li>The OR Operator</li>
               
                <p>
                    In regular expressions, the "or" operator is represented by the pipe symbol (|). It functions as a
                    logical OR, allowing you to specify alternative patterns. The regular expression will match if any
                    of the alternatives match. Here's how you can use the "or" operator:</p>

                <li>bracket expression</li>
                
                <p>A bracket expression, also known as a character class, is a way to specify a set of characters within
                    square brackets [] in a regular expression. It defines a group of characters, and the regular
                    expression engine matches any single character from that defined set. Here are some key points about
                    bracket expressions:

                    Syntax:

                    The basic syntax for a bracket expression is [characters].
                    For example, [abc] matches any single character that is either 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
                    Character Ranges:

                    You can specify a range of characters using a hyphen - inside the square brackets. For example,
                    [a-z] matches any single lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'.
                    Ranges can also be specified for digits and other character types.
                    Negation:

                    Placing a caret ^ at the beginning of the bracket expression negates it. example being, [^0-9] matches
                    any single character that is not a digit.
                    Special Characters Inside Bracket Expressions:

                    Certain characters inside the bracket expression have special meanings, such as ^, -, ], and \.
                    For example, to include the literal hyphen '-' in the character class, you can place it at the
                    beginning or end of the expression.
                    Combining Characters:

                    You can combine different character classes inside the square brackets. For example, [A-Za-z]
                    matches any single alphabetic character (both uppercase and lowercase).
                    Quantifiers with Bracket Expressions:

                    Quantifiers can be applied to bracket expressions. example being, [0-9]{2} matches any two consecutive
                    digits.
                    Common Use Cases:

                    Bracket expressions are commonly used for specifying character sets in various scenarios, such as
                    validating input or extracting specific patterns from a text.
                    Examples:

                    [0-9]: Matches any single digit.
                    [A-Za-z]: Matches any single alphabetic character (case-sensitive).
                    [^aeiou]: Matches any single character that is not a vowel.
                    [0-9A-Fa-f]: Matches any single hexadecimal digit.</p>
